# Relative diversity: Experiment 1

Frequency-dependent benefits of host diversity (dilution effects) are widespread in natural host-pathogen systems. Increasing the number of resistant or low-quality hosts decreases the fraction of susceptible hosts, reducing contact rates between free-living pathogens or infectious individuals, which in turn limits the basic reproduction number of the pathogen. Frequency-dependence can influence phage dynamics and evolutionary emergence.

If we assume no cross-infection, then the dilution effect could still operate even if a host population is challenged by a diverse pathogen population. A phage can only ever infect one host genotype, and if that hostâ€™s relative frequency depends on host diversity, phage spread could potentially be limited. Consequently, the dilution effect may maintain host protection in the context of challenge by a diverse phage population. Further, accounting for phage diversity may also limit evolutionary emergence at intermediate host diversity, as the whole host population is potentially infected thereby reducing selection on each phage genotype to evolve.  

The hypotheses are then:
1. If the dilution effect maintains diversity-mediated host protection, phage titre will be statistically similar among treatments with poly- or monoclonal phage.

2a. If the dilution effect maintains diversity-mediated host protection, overall CRISPR selection rate will be statistically similar among treatments with poly- or monoclonal phage.

2b. IIf the dilution effect maintains diversity-mediated host protection, the selection rate of the lacZ-tagged CRISPR clone will increase with CRISPR diversity.

3. If the whole host population is infected and seleciton for evolutionary emergence is limited, we will observe a smaller proportion of phage that evovle to infect new hosts in treatments with polyclonal phage compared to monoclonal phage.

To test these hypotheses, the experiment uses the following relative diversity treatments shown below: 3-host x 3-phage; 6-host x 6-phage; 12-host x 12-phage; 24-host x 24-phage. Essentially, the logic is to keep relative diversity constant while changing absolute diversity. The experiment lasted for 3 days post-infection (dpi), and phage titre and the host (labelled and unlabelled) were monitored each day. We are also comparing the data from this experiment with the raw data in Common et al (2019) biorXiv, as these are the same host diversity treatments but infected with pre-evolved monoclonal phage. This provides a test of the overall effect of the interaction of phage diversity with host diversity.
