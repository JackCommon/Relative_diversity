# Experiment 2

This experiment represents a larger, scaled up version of experiment 1. Here, I have included a 48-clone treatment, and also a treatment where each host CRISPR diversity level is infected with either 1 infective phage genotype, or by the same number of infective phage genotypes as CRISPR diversity.
